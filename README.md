# _Loan Defaulter Prediction System_

Loan Defaulter Prediction System was a Data analysis and Machine Learning project that I developed during my Data Science Engineering Methods and Tools course at Northeastern University.

- Perform  exploratory  data  analysis,  gather  insights  about the  data,  perform  feature  engineering,  create  a  training-testing split, and prepare the data for modeling.
- Train  and  evaluate  different  machine  learning  models, tune  hyperparameters  and  reduce  overfitting  to  improve the model. 
- Finally to predict if a client will default loan or not based on the given features/parameters.
